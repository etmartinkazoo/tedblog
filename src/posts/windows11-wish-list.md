Using Linux everyday makes me appreciate some of the things Windows does well. There is something really nice about how polished Windows 11 is, the great software selection, and so many other niceties of modern operating systems. What delights me most about Windows as a software developer is just how well the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) works. It really is like having Linux on your machine and makes things like Docker, development, and other tasks feel so seemless.

Nevertheless, Linux absolutely nails some things that I wish Windows would pick up. Whether you are using Gnome, Cinnamon, or other Desktop Environments (DE), you have extreme customizability in ways that far transcend mere ascthetics. I am thinking in particular about shortcuts for everything from closing windows, showing the Desktop, showing workspaces, opening applications, etc... No matter what you want to do, you can create a keyboard shortcut for it. This is so important for power users. Perhaps I am missing something obvious but I would love a similar set of options on Windows.

Another wish is how most DEs treat workspaces. Namely the ability to create seperate desktops and move between them simply and easily with keyboard shortcuts as well as moving windows between these workspaces. It really does help with focus. For example, I keep my terminals on my first workspace, web browsers on the second, code editor and tools on the third, and communication - Slack, Signal Messenger, etc... - and music apps on the fourth. This keeps things neatly ordered and compartmentalized.

It is a great time to be a power user and you really can't go wrong with either Windows or Linux in 2022.
