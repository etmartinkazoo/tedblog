## News
The news is not only 24/7, it is 24/7 hyperbole, negativity, and *depressing*. The news has a very specific business model: advertising. That means they need **eyeballs** and they need *your* time. It is a clear conflict of interest.

## Your Brain
Oh yeah, it is also really bad for our brains to constantly rip our focus, our energy, and our emotions from the present and those with whom we are spending time into the newsphere. It makes you sad and spirals you into the dopamine loop they have so carefully crafted.

## Life
We need to take our lives back from "The News", Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and all of the many businesses whose very model is to addict you. They are smarter than you and will succeed. Life is so precious and short, don't waste it on something as soul sucking as the modern day news cycle. This goes for both the "left" and the "right".
