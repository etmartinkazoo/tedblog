## Framework Laptop
I purchased the Framework Laptop over Christmas. I won't review it here as there are many very good reviews out there. It is an excellent laptop, nay, the best laptop I've ever used. It is modular, upgradable, and works perfectly for my needs. However, there are issues with Linux that are not specific to the Framework Laptop but to Linux.

## Fractional Scaling
If you are a software developer, Linux is an excellent choice. Distros, customizability, etc... are secondary to stability, speed, Docker just working instead of Docker Desktop on Mac and Windows, etc... Some Linux Desktop Environments like Linux Mint also have excellent workspace functionality that fosters multi tasking in sane ways. On my desktop with a 32' 1440p monitor, everything just works. I don't think about the OS, it never freezes, it is not making calls back to Microsoft or Apple just to run apps, etc... I can sit down, focus on my work, and do just that, *work*. A computer to me is like a truck: you use it for functionality and productivity. For all of these reasons, you would have to pry Linux out of my cold dead hands to get it from me.

Laptops are different though. Most laptops have screens that are either 1080p or 4k but on 13' to 15' screens which means you need something called *fractional scaling* to see the screen and interface without your eyes bleeding from strain. The problem is that no matter how you spin it, the state of fractional scaling in Linux is terrible. Mac and Windows are much better in this regard.

So, in sum, the Framework Laptop would be the *perfect* Linux laptop if they would start selling a lower resolution screen that would work well at 1x scaling. This is one of th reasons I purchased the Framework Laptop, so I can switch out components. Having a low resolution screen option, preferably matte, in the Marketplace would be a dream. Until then, I'll begrudgingly run Windows on it and Linux on my desktop.
