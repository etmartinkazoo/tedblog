      <h5 class="text-center">January 15, 2022</h5>
      <hr>
      <p>2021 was a beautiful year and a year of frustration. Beautiful because I was able to spend time with my wife, daughter, family, and friends. Frustrating because we are still in the midst of a global pandemic that is clear as mud vis a vis the right approach to life both collectively and personally. I'm not going to say more about that as there is nothing helpful to say and more importantly, I have <em>no</em> expertise in epidemiology or public health.</p>
<p>2021 aside and behind, I want to write more this year. I'll write some things about technical persuits with code but I also want to write about the things for which I am grateful, the things I wonder about, and even the things that disturb me.</p>
<p>Writing has always given me energy, joy, and deep satisfaction. It is something that both challenges and heals. It challenges because writing admits no sloppiness of thought. A word written is a thought <em>comitted</em>; I love that about writing. It forces you to take a stand, even if that stand be the acknowledgment of mystery; it is an acknowledgment non the less.</p>
<p>Writing is healing because it places something of our vulnerability and intimacy before others. Yes, many are cruel in their judgement but we also learn we have less to fear than we think.</p>
<p>I look forward to writing more in the coming days and months, cheers!</p>
